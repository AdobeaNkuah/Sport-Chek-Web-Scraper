# Sport-Chek-Web-Scraper
A web scraper which navigates Sport Chek's product category webpages, extracts the product information, and exports the data to a SQL database.


## Installation 
This script is compatible with Python 3.0 and Windows. To run this script the following prerequisites must be met.

### Prerequisites
An installation of the following Python modules:

```python
pip install bs4
pip install sqlite3
pip install pandas
pip install selenium
```

An installation of Google Chrome Beta, the Python script will update it automatically.  
An up-to-date version of Chrome Beta is available here: https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/beta/  

The Chrome Beta application should be saved to the file path "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome Beta\Application". Ensure that it exists in this file path or edit the line of code containing the file path accordingly.

```python
chrome_options.binary_location = "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome Beta\Application\chrome.exe"
```


## How to use
Paste the URLs of the Sport Chek categories to be scraped in the "urls.txt" file line by line. Please note that the URLs used in this script **MUST** contain the product page number at the end. Here are some examples:

```text
https://www.sportchek.ca/categories/women/footwear/hiking-outdoor-shoes.html?page=1
https://www.sportchek.ca/categories/shop-by-sport/training/mens-training/mens-training-long-sleeves.html?page=1
https://www.sportchek.ca/categories/electronics/headphones-speakers/headphones.html?page=1
```

Upon the first run of the script a database will be created with SQLite

```python
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE product_information(product_number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, product_name TEXT,
            price TEXT, product_on_sale TEXT, product_categories TEXT, product_description TEXT, image_address TEXT)''')
```

To overwrite the information saved to the database uncomment the statement below and run the script again.

```python
c.execute('''DROP TABLE product_information''')  # Include after table creation to delete table for next testing round
```

While the script is running **DO NOT** minimize or manually interact with the webpage, this will interrupt the script's function.


## Results
The results of the web scraping will be printed in the run window of your Python IDE. This script utilizes the pandas framework to make the results readable.

For example, scraping the products found from this webpage:

```text
https://www.sportchek.ca/categories/shop-by-sport/camping-equipment/tents.html?page=1
```

Creates this database:

```text
    product_number                                            product_name    price product_on_sale                                                              product_categories                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 product_description                                                                                                                                                           image_address
